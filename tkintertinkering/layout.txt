if not LOCAL:
    Every thread spawns a DrawThread
    Every DrawThread gets a Queue, and uses that to update a DrawClass inheriting from Tkinter.Frame
else:
    Main thread spawns as many DrawClasses as clients
    Every client gets a Queue and pushes updates to it
    Main thread reads from all queues in a loop, updates DrawClasses
